pres_and_access.vbs (VBScript)

Requires: Microsoft Office 2007+, Windows XP or greater

Description:
This VBScript uses MS Office to batch convert select formats into formats well-suited for access and preservation.  It uses the file naming structure in use with Archivematica, and thus should work well with Archivematicaâ€™s manual file normalization process.  For example, given the following set of files:

\Correspondence\
   \Email1.rtf
   \Email2.wpd
   \Email3.doc
   \Email4.docx
   \Letters
      \form-letter.mlm
\Installation budget
   \Budget1.xls
\Presentations
   \Pres1.ppt
   \old
      \Pres_old.ppt

Will produce the following set of files:

{all files above, plus the following new directory}
\manualNormalization
   \access
      \Correspondence
         Email1.pdf
         Email2.pdf
         Email3.pdf
         Email4.pdf
         \Letters
            form-letter.pdf
      \Installation budget
      \Presentations
         Pres1.pdf
         \old
            Pres_old.pdf
   \preservation
      \Correspondence
         Email2.docx
         Email3.docx
         \Letters
            form-letter.docx
      \Installation budget
          Budget1.xlsx
      \Presentations
         Pres1.pptx
         \old
            Pres_old.pptx


As you can see from the above example, the script uses the following as preservation and access formats:
